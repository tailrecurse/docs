## Regenerate Your Wallet

Create a completely new wallet. **Important**: Backup your current wallet first!

  **Important**: - Regenerating creates a NEW wallet - Your OLD wallet remains in Privy but the bot
  stops using it - **Move any funds** from your old wallet before regenerating
</Warning>

## How Export and Import Work

The bot uses Privy's secure infrastructure with HPKE encryption:

1. **Export**: Your private key is encrypted with your browser's public key and sent to you. Only your browser can decrypt it.
2. **Import**: You paste your private key in the browser, which encrypts it before sending to the server. The server imports it securely to Privy.

All encryption happens in your browser - your private key never travels unencrypted.
