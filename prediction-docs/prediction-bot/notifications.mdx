The bot automatically notifies you about new events and when your winning positions become claimable.

### New Event Notifications

You'll receive notifications when new events are discovered in categories you follow:

<img
  src="/images/new-events-notifications.png"
  alt="New events notifications"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>

### Winner Notifications

<img
  src="/images/winner-notification.png"
  alt="Winner notification"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>

## Setting Up Notifications

1. **⚙️ Settings**
2. Toggle notifications for categories you want to get notified:

<img
  src="/images/settings.png"
  alt="Settings screen"
  style={{ display: 'block', margin: '0 auto', maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
/>

## Automatic Enrollment

When you place a bet on an event, notifications for that event's category are **automatically enabled**. You can disable them later in settings if you don't want them.
